    <string name="in_general">In general, it is a day for me to think about putting my feet up. Literally. Ed and I agreed that we could use one comfy chair for reading/writing/lounging on the porch. Just one. He thinks it will look too cluttered with two and I\'m not going to push him on it. He can stay on the house couch. I\'m the one who is pining for a front row seat with a view toward my flower beds.</string>
